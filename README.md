# vimrc
So I may have my .vimrc, wherever I may be. 


## How to use

1. Clone this repo to the root directoy of the system 


2. Install vundle 

  Details can be found here.
  (https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

  Part of setting up vundle is having code in the .vimrc, and the other half is cloning vundle's repo onto the local system.
  This can be done with the following command:  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
  ```

3. Install vundle and remaining plugins

  Just run vim, then run the command 
  ```
  :PluginInstall
  ```
  This will configure vundle as well as all other plugins.

## Other Notes
This is mainly for personal use and it works very well for me, but it is far from complete, and far from universal.
Thanks to all who have made plugins for vim!
